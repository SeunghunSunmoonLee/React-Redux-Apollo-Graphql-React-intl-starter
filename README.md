I'm planning to write more tests, implement bilingual feature.

### Things Done:
* Write client side JS code (usage of modern libraries is allowed)
* Write server side JS code (usage of modern libraries is allowed)
* Write CSS that is easily optimisable, cachable and well structured
* Write in ES6 or ES7 (so no TypeScript, CoffeeScript or other superset languages)
* Write unit tests
* All code must be in english (variable names, comments etc..)

### Things to do:
* Write universal/common/isomorphic JS code
* Create a docker file
* Comment your code wherever you feel necessary
* Use CSS preprocessors and postprocessors
* use authentication middleware
* Implement a nice UI/UX
* Write a bilingual page (englisch and any second language)

### Pages
The platform contains at least two pages:
* Login page
* Data page

#### Login page
The login page contains a login form or a social login implementation.

#### Data page
A logged in user should see all data.
